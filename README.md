# Early-Disease-Detection-Model
This project involves building an AI-driven health diagnostic system for the early detection of Heart Disease and Parkinsonâ€™s Disease using machine learning techniques. It analyzes patient health data to deliver accurate, data-backed predictions to support early diagnosis and preventive care.

Technologies Used:
-Python: For coding, data handling, and model development.

-Pandas & NumPy: For data preprocessing and manipulation.

-Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models and evaluating performance.

-Google Colab: Used as the development environment.

Key Features:
-Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled features for optimal model performance.

-Feature Engineering: Identified key health indicators influencing disease risk.

-Machine Learning Models: Trained and compared several models including:

-->Random Forest

-->Support Vector Machine (SVM)

-->Logistic Regression

-->K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

-->Naive Bayes

Model Evaluation: Evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and k-fold cross-validation. Achieved over 90% accuracy in predicting both diseases.

Objective:
To provide a reliable and efficient system for early detection of critical illnesses, helping healthcare providers in risk assessment and timely intervention.
